# Hello, folks!
Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

My name is Katherine Biggs and I'm an aspiring software developer, currently enrolled on **Code Institute's** [Full Stack Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course. I'm from the UK, living in Worcestershire and currently running my own yoga studio. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gmyogakat?lang=en),  or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kat-biggs-a658059/).

# What's a yoga teacher doing coding websites?
I get asked this all the time.  The truth is, I've always been a coder, since I was about 8 years old and coding pretty patterns on my Acorn Electron.  I built my first website in 1999/2000 (it doesn't exist anymore).  As a solopreneur for the last 9 years, building my yoga business from one class a week in a church hall, to a yoga studio with classes 7 days per week, I have always looked after my own web presence.

During lockdown in 2020, I rebuilt my [yoga studio website](http://greatmalvernyoga.co.uk/) using a Wordpress template and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to learn more.

# Technologies I've been learning
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
There's more to come!  I still have two more projects to complete as part of my Code Institute course.  I'm due to finish at the end of July 2022.

# Further work history
I've not always been a yoga teacher!  I've always worked in marketing, in one way or another.  I used to be a fruit buyer - what I don't know about blueberries is not worth knowing.  From the food industry, I moved to the marketing department of a packaging company because they wanted someone with knowledge of the food industry.  I learned marketing management skills, including agency management, PR, advertising and marketing planning.  I don't want to write my whole cv here, so if you want to know more about me, please click on my linkedin profile above.  Portfolio website coming soon!
